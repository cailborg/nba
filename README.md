# NBA Stats Scraper

## Introduction
I built this specifically to automate the scoring process for the custom NBA fantasy league my friends and I participate in.
I saw there was a [python script](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) to scrape data from [stats.nba.com](stats.nba.com) but I wanted to build something that worked in javascript. Ultimately, using the stats.nba.com feed was too unreliable with the amount of calls I needed to make so i've refactored it to use the excellent [balldontlie API](balldontlie.io)


## Usage
Run `npm install` for dependencies
Run `npm start` to start the server


## Notes
This is a server-side application only at the moment, but am aiming to build a front end for it at some point.
